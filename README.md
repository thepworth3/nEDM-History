# nEDM-History
This repository contains the data for all nEDM measurements as of January 2025, and allows one to plot them. It includes shaded regions for different theory predictions. New data can be added, and aspects of the plot can be altered/removed. 

Data includes nEDM upper limits, experiment method, lab which preformed the experiment, year of publication, and a reference (although not all measurements have a reference)
